# hello-world

Hi!

I'm Elon Reeve Musk, a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Moving on with wild ventures, became multimillionaire in late 20s when I sold start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.
